In no particular order do these things:
1. Page styles
2. Correct image sizes for both phone and pc
3. Figure out alignment of header
4. Get unbanned from formkeep/formwhatever (Google forms might work too, google it)
5. Recipe search functionality
6.

Other Ideas:
1. Random recipe selector, maybe for up to 7 recipes
2. Newest recipe updates
3. life updates on site?
